## Scene-switching bug fix
> 08-June-2016 (commit 36df87) v0.6.9 

- A bug causing crashes or disconnects sometimes when switching scenes in Direct Mode has been fixed.


## Anti-aliasing working with RenderManager
> 24-March-2016 (commit f97c8a) v0.6.6

- Anti-aliasing now works on the RenderManager rendering path. Previously, it was not inheriting that setting from Unity's Quality Settings. This gets set at RenderTexture creation time. If developers want to adjust AA dynamically, they would have to recreate the RenderTextures, since that RT property cannot be adjusted dynamically.

### RenderManager update
> 28-January-2016 (commit d8a6a2) v0.6.4

- Updated to RenderManager v0.6.36 which includes AMD Direct-to-Display mode. 
- Change to VRDisplayTracked prefab to better support image effects and custom camera scripts. By default, one VREye and one VRSurface (camera) are included in the prefab. Image effects can be applied to the VRSurface object, which will be duplicated to create additional eyes if necessary.

> 25-November-2015 (commit 4ca38e) v0.6.104-g4cae38e

- Added support for RenderManager in Unity 5.2+. RenderManager features include nVidia Direct Mode, Timewarp, and Distortion correction. Works on 700 series or newer nVidia cards with latest (359.0) or slightly older drivers. The following DLLs are also required for RenderManager (these aren't yet included in the Unity package):
 - osvrUnityRenderingPlugin.dll, built from [OSVR-Unity-Rendering](https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-Unity-Rendering)
 - osvrRenderManager.dll, from [RenderManager installer](http://resource.osvr.com/public_download/RenderManager/osvrRenderManager_0_6_23_unsigned.msi)
 - glew32.dll, from RenderManager installer
 - SDL2.dll, from RenderManager installer
 These are all included in the OSVR-Unity-Palace demo.
 
 - Support for displays with two video inputs, such as the Sensics dSight. If the server is configured to use a display with two video inputs, Unity builds will open in a double-wide window rather than fullscreen mode.
 
 - VRFirstPersonController prefab enables simple navigation. The new example scene VRFirstPerson.unity demonstrates its use.
 

### ClientKit Rendering Parameters update
> 13-September-2015 (commit 34fd6f1) v0.2.119-g34fd6f1

- This update simplifies the Unity plugin by retrieving the output of the computational display model (viewport, projection matrices) from the OSVR-Core API. This eliminates the need to parse JSON display descriptor data in Unity, which allows for improvements in the display model without having to rebuild a game. 

- VRHead.cs has been renamed VRViewer.cs to fit with the display model. Conceptually, a VRViewer has one or more VREyes, and each VREye has a VRSurface which controls rendering (has the camera component) for that VREye. In the scene hierarchy, VRViewer and VREyes are siblings, although conceptually this is a parent-child relationship. The reason for this is because VREye poses are reported in world space, not head space. VRSurfaces are children of VREyes, both conceptually and in the scene hierarchy. Developers will never need to create these manually in their projects, as this is taken care of by a prefab (see below).

- The “VRDisplayTracked” prefab has been improved to create a mono or stereo display at runtime based on the configured number of viewers and eyes. DisplayController.cs is the new script responsible for setting up the display at runtime. The VRDisplayTracked prefab should still work in existing scenes so long as the prefab instance is intact.

- The VRDisplayTracked prefab no longer uses a PoseInterface to update its pose. Rather, viewer and eye poses are retrieved from ClientKit.

- Since the VREyes are now created at runtime and do not exist in the scene hierarchy, developers should be aware that they will need to apply any additional components/effects to each VREye after they are created, rather than in the scene. Each camera's settings are copied from the camera component on the VRDisplayTracked gameobject, but for now, additional components/effects that are attached to VRDisplayTracked are not copied to each eye. This will be a future addition to the plugin.

### InterfaceAdapter update
> 07-July-2015 - v0.2-23-gc3c5dc0

> This update introduces some API improvements. Projects upgrading to the new version should remain backwards compatible, but may want to take this time to replace deprecated components `InterfaceGameObject`, `InterfaceCallbacks`, and `InterfaceBase`:

- Use `OSVR.Unity.OrientationInterface`, `OSVR.Unity.PoseInterface`, and others instead of `InterfaceGameObject`.
- `OSVR.Unity.ButtonInterface` and `OSVR.Unity.AnalogInterface` are now available.
- `OSVR.Unity.RequiresOrientationInterface` and others are now available. These replace `InterfaceBase` and allow you to require a specific interface type.
- A set of Unity-specific `OSVR.ClientKit.InterfaceAdapter` sub-classes are now available. Use these instead of the deprecated `InterfaceCallbacks` class.
 - Note: `OSVR.ClientKit.ButtonInterface` and `OSVR.ClientKit.AnalogInterface` can be used directly without an adapter.
- `OSVR.Unity.OrientationInterface`, `OSVR.Unity.PoseInterface`, and `OSVR.Unity.PositionInterface` now use the OSVR state APIs instead of the callback APIs.

### Update/rename of Managed-OSVR assembly
> 30-June-2015 - v0.2 (commit 429546f) and approximately v0.1-94-gf4d3c44

- The Unity plugin now uses the external [Managed-OSVR][] project and assembly, providing improved reliability, development progress, and **64-bit support**. Yes, this means you can now use OSVR-Unity with the default Windows version of Unity 5.x (which is 64-bit unless you seek out otherwise).
- Projects upgrading to the new version should remove all copies of `ClientKit.dll` from their `Assets` (including subdirectories) **before** importing the updated package, as the file has been renamed to `OSVR.ClientKit.dll` to match .NET conventions.
- Projects upgrading to the new version may want to also remove the entire `OSVRUnity` folder **before** importing the updated package, to ensure any references to JSON display descriptor files are removed, as these files are no longer included in the Unity plugin.

### Displays Folder removed
> 31-May-2015 - v0.1.78-ge7ad2a0

- Unity developers no longer need to assign a JSON display descriptor in the Unity editor. The OSVR server sends the display descriptor to Unity, so switching HMDs requires changing the server config file to use a different display, not recompiling your Unity project. 

### DLL Search Path
> 31-March-2015 - v0.1-69-gb80966b

- The built executable will now find the plugins it needs in the _Data folder. Previously, the executable had to be in the same directory with Assets/Plugins. That is no longer necessary.  (Basically, don't worry about copying DLLs - it should always work correctly on its own, whether you're in the editor or a build.)

### Substantially Reduced Latency
> 30-March-2015 - v0.1-65-g09dc6fa

- We're now handling OSVR messages more frequently (in more steps of the Unity run loop) so rendering, among other interactions, has much fresher data.

### External Json File
> 28-March-2015 - v0.1-56-gf2d8bab

- The JSON file containing display configuration can now be read from a file at runtime. To do this, add a config file "hmd.json" to the _Data folder that is created in a build. The format of the JSON file has not changed at all. It is the same file you would drag-and-drop onto the DisplayInterface component on your VRDisplayTracked prefab. If "hmd.json" does not exist in the Data folder (and it won't by default unless you put it there), then the plugin will look for the JSON file assigned in the DisplayInterface component in your scene. If that also has not been assigned, it will fall back to reading OSVR's /display parameter (this will eventually be the default).

### Distortion
> 20-March-2015 - v0.1-55-g046c709

- For HMDs that require it, the plugin can turn on a customized distortion shader. This works with Unity 4 Pro or Unity 5. If you're using Unity 4 Free, you might see an error or warning, and there won't be distortion (due to render to texture pass required), but everything else will still work fine.
- Fixed Timestep was changed from 0.2 to 0.01667. This is how often FixedUpdate() gets called. The change should result in a more comfortable VR experience, but make sure it doesn't break any physics in your game.
- Changed the default quality settings. Turned on 4x AA and disabled shadows.

### Unity 5 Update
> 18-March-2015 - v0.1-55-g046c709

- Refactored VRHead.cs and VREye.cs to be Unity 5-friendly (mostly instances of "camera" that needed to become `GetComponent<Camera>()`). Upgrading from Unity 4 to Unity 5 should be seamless.
- `VRDisplayTracked.prefab` has been updated to use the json descriptor file for the HDK by default. If you are using another HMD, be sure to set the corresponding json file on the `VRDisplayTracked` prefab's `DisplayInterface` script. 
- Fixed issue with stereo overlap and roll for HMDs with multiple video inputs.
